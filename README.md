# 💼 Ngoma Job Board

## 🌍 Project Overview

Ngoma Job Board was born out of a simple yet urgent need: bridging the gap between job seekers and local opportunities in Ngoma District. Too many talented individuals were struggling to find work—not because they lacked skills or ambition, but because opportunities weren’t visible, accessible, or well-connected to the local community.

What began as a grassroots initiative quickly evolved into a digital platform driven by passion, purpose, and community. Our small but dedicated team—made up of local professionals, job seekers, and changemakers—set out to build more than just a job board. We wanted to build a bridge between employers and job seekers, empower youth, and change the narrative around rural employment.
