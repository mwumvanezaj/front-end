# Ngoma Job Board

## Project Overview

Ngoma Job Board was born out of a simple yet urgent need: bridging the gap between job seekers and local opportunities in Ngoma District. Too many talented individuals were struggling to find work, not because they lacked skills or ambition, but because opportunities weren’t visible, accessible, or well-connected to the local community.
